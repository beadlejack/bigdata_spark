### Description 

This project contains two Spark applications to run two queries on a movie review dataset
pulled from IMDB and provided by the instructor. The report PDF describes how to execute the
JAR files and how these applications compared to previous MapReduce jobs running the same queries.
Previous MapReduce jobs and Hive queries can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/beadlejack/bigdata_mapreduce_hive).

This project uses Spark RDDs to analyze and query the movie review dataset. The code is written in 
Scala. The files contain all project files for an Intellij IDE project. 

The report mentions a Twitter emerging topics detector. For more information and to see the code, check
